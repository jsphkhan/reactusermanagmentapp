# Project Title

React Simple User Management App

## Description
Simple User Management App created with React JS. Has the following features
1. Authenticating user with username and password
2. Create, update, and delete user
3. See the user detail

This demo uses fake json-server data to create, update, delete and authenticate users. This repository has 3 folders,
* admin-app : The Admin Management App interface. Admin can create, view, update and delete users. This app was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter kit
* user-app : The User App interface. User can only login and see his details. For simplicity of the demo, the actions are restircted. This app was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) start kit.
* fake-server : fake json-server folder which has a db.json file. All related data are inside the json file. Read more about json-server [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS v6.10.3 and up - Install Node JS from its [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* NPM (Node package manager) - npm is installed along with NodeJS. My version at the time of commit was v6.0.1.
* yarn - yarn is considered faster than npm. If you do not want to use npm commands then you can use yarn. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).
* In case you want to deploy to a live Heroku or Now server, then follow the instructions provided by them.

## Getting Started and Installing

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

* First Git clone the repo into your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/jsphkhan/react-user-management-app.git
```
The cloned repository/folder has 3 folders inside it as described above.

### Running the json-server
You can do it in 2 ways

#### 1. Start the server directly
* First install the json-server as a global npm module (if you do not have it already) to use the REST interface that is used by the applications.
```
$ npm install -g json-server
```
* And then start the server to bring up the REST interface. Please note that my server runs on port 3002. You can change this in the command, but the same thing also needs to be changed inside admin-app/src/config/config.js or user-app/src/config/config.js to update the port.
```
$ cd fake-server
$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3002
```
#### 2. Use the Node interface provided with this project
```
$ cd fake-server
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

### Running the Admin App
* Open your terminal
```
$ cd admin-app
$ npm install
```
* This should install all the dependencies. Once done
* Run 
``` 
$ yarn start
or
$ npm start
```
* to start the server.
* open (http://localhost:3000) in your browser. 
* This should open up the Admin App
* Use this account to login. (admin/admin@123)

### Running the User App
* Open your terminal
```
$ cd user-app
$ npm install
```
* This should install all the dependencies. Once done
* Run 
``` 
$ yarn start 
or 
$ npm start
```
* to start the server.
* open (http://localhost:3001) in your browser. User App is configured to run in port 3001. If you want to change, you can do so inside package.json
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "PORT=3001 react-scripts start"
 }
```
* This should open up the User App
* There are already few fake users created. You can login with one of them (john/yahoo@123). You can see all of them inside the fake-server/db.json file.
* You can create more users from the Admin App and then login inside the User App.

### Connecting to the fake JSON server. 
You can configure the path and port of the json-server inside the admin-app and user-app so that they can make API calls. 
File path is: 
* Admin App: admin-app/src/config/config.js
* User App: user-app/src/config/config.js
```
export default {
	baseUrl: 'http://localhost',
	dbPort: '3002'
}
```
By default they are pointing to localhost. In case you have deployed your fake json-server to a live server (using Now, Heroku) then you need to change the configuration. Here's an example of my configuration where my Admin and User apps are making call to the json-server hosted in Now.
```
export default {
	baseUrl: 'https://fake-json-server-mpszeqeyaf.now.sh',
	dbPort: ''
}
```

## Running the tests
-- Open for improvement --

## Deployment
#### Generating Production build for admin-app
```
$ cd admin-app
$ npm run build
or
$ yarn build
```

#### Generating Production build for user-app
```
$ cd user-app
$ npm run build
or
$ yarn build
```
Builds both the apps for production into their respective build folders.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build (eg. admin-app/build) for the best performance.

#### Deploying yourself
You can deploy to [Now](https://zeit.co/now#whats-now) or [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) servers. Instructions can be followed from their website. Here's an example of how I deployed the admin-app to Now. 

```
$ cd build
$ now --name react-admin-app
```
You can deploy your fake json server as well. Here's how I did,
```
$ cd fake-server
$ now --name fake-json-server
```
But before deploying directly to Now, you need to install their command line tool or Desktop application and login. 

## Live Demo (eg. Now)
I have deployed the applications into Now servers. Why I chose Now over Heroku? - because I found Now easier to deploy my app.
Here are the live demo URL's:
* Admin App (login with admin/admin@123) : [https://react-admin-app-tnpcfpugif.now.sh/](https://react-admin-app-tnpcfpugif.now.sh/)
* User App : [https://react-user-app-gafefwrjje.now.sh/](https://react-user-app-gafefwrjje.now.sh/)
* Fake JSON Server : [https://fake-json-server-mpszeqeyaf.now.sh/](https://fake-json-server-mpszeqeyaf.now.sh/)

## Built With

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - The React JS starter kit used.
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS library.
* [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - For routing and navigation.

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jsphkhan/react-user-management-app/blob/master/Contributing.md) for details on the process of submitting a pull request.

## Known Issues/Limitations

* Lacks a proper authentication and authorization model. json-server is a fake REST API server and as such its functionalities are limited. This can be improved when used with a proper NodeJS backend with JWT tokens
* The intention of this project is to create a React boilerplate that can be used for learning purpose.
